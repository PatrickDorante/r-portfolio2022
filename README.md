 6 Phases of Data Analysis 
 ### Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act
 
 We'll learn the different techniques 
 how processing each phase and exploring data analysis. 
 Several software tools were used for this case study.


 ## Company Mission
    Since launched in 2016, Cyclistic has grown across 
    Chicago with a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked 
    and locked into a network of 692 stations. 
    Their systems have made it easy for riders to unlock bikes 
    from one station and return to any other station at any time. 
    The Cyclistic’ s marketing strategy success made possible 
    because of the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, 
    full-day passes = casual riders, and annual memberships.

#### Cyclistic’s marketing Problem
The Cyclistic’s marketing strategy is 
to predict customer interactions in the last 12 months.
As members of the marketing team, our tasks are going to
explore hypothesis and predictions on 
How annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

Given [dataset](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), 
made available by Motivate International Inc.

our fictional business objectives aim to increasing revenues at
converting casual riders into annual members.

and data driven decisions.


# Preparation and Processing Phases
These phases involve load of data and evaluation.
The 12 months of datasets contain 
- Total Rows: 4,358,611
- Total Columns: 13
A total number of 431585 missing 
and null values will be filtered out.


##### Data Preparation Tools 
- R - analysis and visualization
