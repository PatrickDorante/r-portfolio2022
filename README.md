 6 Phases of Data Analysis 
 ### Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act
 
 we'll learn the different techniques 
 how processing each phase and exploring data analysis. 
 Several software tools were used for this case study.


 ## Company Mission
    Since launched in 2016, Cyclistic has grown across 
    Chicago with a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked 
    and locked into a network of 692 stations. 
    Their systems have made it easy for riders to unlock bikes 
    from one station and return to any other station at any time. 
    The Cyclistic’ s marketing strategy success made possible 
    because of the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, 
    full-day passes = casual riders, and annual memberships.

# Ask Phase

### Cyclistic’s marketing Problem
The Cyclistic’s marketing strategy is 
to predict customer interactions in the last 12 months.
As members of the marketing team, our tasks are going to
explore hypothesis and predictions by comparing 
how Cyclistic's bikes usage differ 
between annual and casual riders.

- How can you help the stakeholders resolve their questions?
- How can your insights drive business decisions?

##### Key tasks 

- Identify stakeholders of the project 
- Marketing Director/Manager
- Executive Team

##### Deliverable Scenario
Provide insights with relevant data sources 
and cleaning, key findings,
provide meaningful data visualization support 
and data driven decisions.


# Prepare Phase  

##### Data Extraction
Given real [datasets](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
available at Motivate International Inc. 
[license here](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement), 
we will use 12 months data from April 2020 to May 2021 for
our fictional business, which aims at increasing revenues
with their service's bikes share, by converting casual riders 
into annual members.


# Process Phase

##### Keys tasks
Janitor, Tidyverse, and gglplot2 packages for data cleansing and visualization using in R.
Data will be loaded & stored with different variables.
Missing and non-null values to 
sort and filter out.
Data missed key elements such as demographic, income, age 

##### Data cleaning 
- Total Rows: 4,358,611
- Total Columns: 13
- Total missing and non-values: 431585  


### Data Preparation Tools 
- R - analysis and visualization
- Microsoft SQL Server & Excel
- Tableau - create data visualization and reports
- Jupyter Notebook - data analysis and visualizations
